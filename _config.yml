  Hello my name is Michael Coponiti, and I am a current GIS Masters candidate at the University of Oklahoma with a previous Masters degree in Strategic Intelligence studies. In my initial Masters research on the strategic value of the South Chian Sea I became fascinated with the geographic factors that made this narrow sea a crucial security priority for the US and its regional allies. This has inspired me to combine my knowledge of strategic intelligence and geospatial data to pursue a career as a GEOINT analyst.
